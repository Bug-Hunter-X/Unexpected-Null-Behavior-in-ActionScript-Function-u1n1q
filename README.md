This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in ActionScript related to handling null values with type-hinted function parameters.  The `bug.as` file contains code that passes a null value to a function expecting a String, leading to unexpected behavior in the trace statements.  The solution in `bugSolution.as` demonstrates a robust way to handle this by checking for null values before using them. This highlights the importance of explicit null checks in ActionScript to avoid runtime errors and unexpected results.
